# Breed Identification System 

Breed Identification System is designed to predict the class of a species of animal. For this project we have chosen Dog, Cat and Fish dataset through open-source commmunities. All datasets were trained on 3 CNN architectures MobileNetV2, ResNet18 and ResNet50, and as result we got 9 instances from scratch, 6 instances for transfer learning and multiple instances for hyperparameter tuning. In this report we discuss different outcomes we got from training (scratch and transfer), hyperparameter tuning, TSNE visualization and what we can infer from all the experimentation done in course of this project.

## Train
All models related files attached are in the form of notebooks with imports and pip install commands in place, and the datasets link can be found below to run your own training instance, data modifier codes can also be in the repo to help prepare your data.

## Testing
As per the requirements of the project, we have created a sample test data comprising of 100 images, it can be found here,
